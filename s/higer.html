    <h1>HIGHER SECONDARY (+2)</h1>
    <p>After students complete their SEE examinations they have two streams to choose from at Mahabouddha. Pursuing +2 in Science is suitable for the students opting to create/join a career in the field of Science and Technology and related disciplines. 10 + 2 in science entitles a student with the eligibility to pursue a career in the field of Medicine, Engineering and other applied and theoretical natural science sectors.</p><br>
    <p>Plus two in Science offers an integrated package in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics. The program aims to equip students with a level fit for further studies in technology, medicine, engineering and biotechnology. Plus two in Science is for those students who have an aptitude for science and mathematics. This program aims to develop strong foundation in students. On completion students can pursue their further studies in medicine, engineering or other science related studies.</p><br>
    <p>Similary, we have also introduced the Business School Program. The objective of this program is to impart fundamental knowledge in basic areas of management so that it forms a stepping stone for higher level of management study. In this level, students will be introduced to the concepts, subject matter and elementary skills in various functional areas of management like general management, accountancy, finance, office practices and marketing</p>
