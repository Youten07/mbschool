 <h2><u>About</u></h2><br>
 <p>In the hidden land of majestic Himalayas was were the school Maha Bouddha(Yalbang). It is a wonderful place for one to study as the atmosphere is perfect for learning and the teachers are well trained. The school has multiple buildings, sports fields two private hostels, computer facilities, a place where there is a hard time finding a phone signal the school HCS internet-Service for children to gain knowledge all around. Music lesson are given to students, mostly Tibetan instrument along with dances. Itâ€™s a one school as it gives a quality study for like the must minimum price. The students here all come from a poor farmer background and gain needed education. The school is the only place which generates maximum quality literacy in the area and till this date due to the school more a hundred students have changed there lives by graduating and moving on further studies, rather then carrying on the farming. Even locals in the school valley are more aware of what is happening and what should be done, which is a great accomplishment.  The school Maha Bouddha received the award of the top 5 best government school allover Nepal from the state at 2016, won every inter school dance competition, produced students  who scored top scores in the S.L.C through out the district competed in the running shield competition for athletes and won numerous trophies, its just a marvelous a achievement for a school which lies between mountains hidden from outside world creating a better future for the country and I am glad to say that I too that I graduated for Maha Bouddha High School.</p>
